/**
 * \brief Provides a ROS control_msgs/FollowJoinTrajectoryAction. Target joint position / velocity to set at the times of playing the trajectory.
 *
 * This class exists mainly in order to provide a means to execute a trajectory with some control
 * over the accuracy of execution, synchronizing the arm state at intermediate trajectory points.
 * The velocity actuators of the real arm are not as accurate
 * as may be required: when executing a trajectory, it may be extremely important to execute it
 * as accurate as possible, as little inaccuracies of only one joint during intermediate trajectory points
 * reflects on the overall pose of the arm. Some motion planners may plan a path such that the arm
 * gets close to obstacles. Little inaccuracies in trajectory execution can then cause collisions with the arm.
 *
 * Also with the newer Gazebo versions (>2), since Joint::SetVelocity() doesn't set the velocity that accurately
 * any more and PID controllers can only do so much, it is necessary to control the trajectory execution and
 * adjust velocities, e.g. backtrack when a position goal has been overshot.
 *
 * The disadvantage of the increased accuracy control is that the execution of the trajectory may not be as
 * smooth.
 *
 * **Prerequisite**
 * This implementation only works well if the joint velocities in the robot can be met fairly well
 * according to the target values provided by this class. As a rule of thumb, an error margin of
 * max. 15-20% *can* be acceptable, but the greater the error, the more often the trajectory execution
 * may get stuck and not reach the target points. Underlying PID controllers should be used in the
 * arm controllers to ensure that the error margin is low.
 *
 * **Usage**
 * A controller which maintains an instance of this class may read the target
 * joint positions/velocities and control the arm accordingly.
 * An array is passed to the constructor (along with a mutex) which will have the current target
 * values updated by this action server as the trajectory is playing.
 * Please refer to the constructor documentation which provides more details on how this
 * class works through the documentation of paramters.
 *
 * **Important TODO**
 * This class has recently been migrated from JointTrajectoryAction to FollowJointTrajectoryAction.
 * Accordingly, this can be improved to read the tolerances from FollowJointTrajectoryAction. In
 * the current implementation, tolerances are set globally for all joints.

     *      This is to determine when the trajectory has finished playing.

     * \param _positionMode If set to true, the joint trajectory is to be played
     *      using joint positions, and the next trajectory point target position are stored in \e _targetPos,
     *      while \e _targetVel remains undefined.
     *      If set to false, target values will be velocities (stored in \e _targetVel), *and* the
     *      current target trajectory point position values will be stored in \e _targetPos.
     * \param _maxVelocities array which contains maximum velocities for all joints.
     *     This only applies if \e _positionMode is false and is reflected in the values of \e targetVel.
     * \param _armAngleSafetyLimit if >=0, trajectories will be rejected which have an angle (radian) greater
     *     than that between two joint positions. If <0, this feature is disabled.
     * \param _goalTolerance the tolerance to allow when detecting whether the arm is at the last trajectory point.
     * \param _interGoalTolerance tolerance to determine whether intermediate trajectory points are reached
     *      *during* execution of trajectory. This only applies when online trajectory execution control
     *      is performed (using \e _useOnlineTrajectoryControl).
     *      It is ensured that each trajectory point is met with this accuracy. The smaller this tolerance,
     *      the more jerky the trajectory execution might be. If this is > goalTolerance,
     *      at the end of trajectory execution a correction might be done to meet the desired end accuracy.
     * \param _simplifyTrajectoryVelocities if set to true, velocities of each incoming trajectory are
     *      simplified to represent linear moves (fixed velocity between trajectory points).
     *      This disregards velocity values originally based on spline interpolations in the trajectory message.
     *      Execution time of trajectory should still be the same but may be adjusted.
     * \param _useOnlineVelocityControl use the on-line control of the trajectory which continually checks
     *      whether the joint has arrived at its intermediate trajectory position.
     *      The trajectory playing is synchronized at each intermediate trajectory point:
     *      if some joints were slower, others wait for it to be at this intermediate
     *      trajectory point. See also documentation of method
     *      TrajectoryActionServer::playTrajectoryOnlineControlled().
     *      Only works if velocity mode is set, so if \e _positionMode is set to true,
     *      it will be reset to false.
